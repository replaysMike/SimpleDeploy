# SimpleDeploy
A simple web deployment service for windows/IIS

## Description
SimpleDeploy is an alternative to IIS Web Deploy. It hosts a service that will accept files/jobs to be deployed to a particular website hosted in IIS, allowing you to run a custom deploy script and upload multiple artifacts via command line/powershell.

## Installing
The installation will require installing the SimpleDeploy Agent which would run on the webserver, and the client application (either console or powershell extension). Download both from the releases section.

### Status
This repo is currently in alpha status and is under testing so limited documentation is currently available.
